I created a board game, but I needed to adapt it to the digital world. The game is aimed at a school context and consists of a board with a spiral design (21 rings), around 400 cards in three categories. The game is intended to be played with at least 5 players. The usual number of players is 25 to 30. I need your help to adapt the board design, cards and gameplay to the digital world. If possible, find a way for each player, using their mobile phone, to move their pawn. Thank you for your attention, Manuel Cruz
Rules: 1. Each player chooses the pawn they most identify with. 2. Everyone places their pawns in the outer ring. 3. One player takes a privilege/discrimination card, reads it out loud and everyone follows the instructions on the card. In other words, they either move forward or back. 4. The player next to them does the same thing and so on until the game ends. 5. The game ends when the first player reaches the central ring.
At the basic level, they only draw cards from the privileges and discrimination categories. At the intermediate level, they draw cards from the privileges/discrimination and social policies categories alternately. At the advanced level, they draw cards from the three categories alternately, and if the player who drew the card ends up in a ring with an event, such as the Crisis event, they must react to that orientation.
The phone should only control the movements, nothing more. Yes, there will be a main screen designed to display the board. I don't have any digital code, just the physically produced game.
Yes, since the design, cards and gameplay are already created physically, I just needed to adapt them digitally. Since it is a digital board game with a multiplayer interface, what program do you recommend?
Each player must use their own phone only to control their pawn while the main board is displayed on that laptop.
